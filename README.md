# Abnormal-Pelvis-Project
The aim of this project is to train a binary classifier that identifies normal and abnormal pelvis using the data 'Vertebral Column', from the source https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/212/vertebral+column. The data has 5 numeric measures of the pelvis, 1 subjective metric for the pain the patients experience, and the label for abnormal pelvis.
